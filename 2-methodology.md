[Interoperability of Learning Records:Â State-of-the-Art in 2023](README.md?fileId=116427)

## 2\. Methodology

The methodology adopted to conduct this exhaustive review on the state of the art regarding the interoperability of Learning Records was primarily literature review. A literature review allows for the comprehensive collection and critical analysis of scholarly works and reputable sources related to the topic at hand.

The first step in the process involved a systematic search for relevant literature through a multitude of databases and academic repositories such as Google Scholar and Academia.edu. In addition to these, we pursued more specified resources for deeper, niche understanding and findings. These special resources included platforms like Github, which hosts a vast array of software related research and resources, HAL Science, which is a multidisciplinary open access archive, and designated websites like xapi.com and imsglobal.org which offer a wealth of information on specific standards related to learning records.

Our search strategy was designed to maximize the capture of relevant literature. We performed keyword-based search using terms that are directly related to the topic under review. The keywords used were 'Learning Records', 'Learning Traces', 'LRS', 'xapi', 'Learning Records Store', 'ims caliper', 'scorm', 'cmi5' and combinations of these terms. These keywords were chosen due to their direct relevance to the study and their potential to yield a plethora of information on the current trends, challenges, and opportunities in the interoperability of Learning Records.

The selection of literature was guided by several criteria. First, the sources had to be relevant to the topic of the interoperability of learning records, specifically focusing on contemporary developments and trends in the field. Second, we prioritized scholarly articles, research papers, and reports that provided in-depth, analytical content over general or basic information. Finally, in terms of exclusion criteria, any sources that were not available in English, that were outdated or irrelevant to the objectives of this review, or that did not offer unique perspectives were excluded.

The methodology adopted in the literature review process facilitated a thorough exploration of the current state of interoperability in Learning Records and allowed for the generation of meaningful insights and considerations for future research and development in this area.
