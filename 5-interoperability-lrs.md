### 5\.1 Learning Locker LRS

Learning Locker LRS is an open-source data store designed to record learning activities in line with the xAPI specification.

Established by HT2 Labs (now known as Learning Pool) in 2014, Learning Locker primary function is to serve as a data storage system specifically designed to hold learning activity statements generated by xAPI compliant activities, as outlined in the Learning Locker Documentation.

The operational architecture of Learning Locker is divided into two key components, each maintained under separate Github repositories. These components are the Learning Locker application and the xAPI service.

The Learning Locker application itself is divided into three key elements: the browser interface (UI), the HTTP interface (API), and the workers. These elements operate as distinct processes, allowing them to share resources without interference. The xAPI service part of Learning Locker involves four elements: statements, activity profiles, agent profiles, and state. This service grants users access to the HTTP Interface, which in turn enables interaction with the xAPI as mentioned in the specification.

Learning Locker collects learning records by recording xAPI statements. These statements are detailed reports of a learner's interactions with a system, and encapsulate a wealth of data including who did what, when, and in what context. Interactions like reading a page, watching a video, or answering a quiz question are examples of the kind of granular data Learning Locker can record.

Data from a variety of sources can be collected, either through direct integration with other applications, software and systems, or by using xAPI to convert and standardize data from older formats like SCORM. Once collected, Learning Locker stores this data in a MongoDB database, where it forms the basis for detailed learner analytics.

Learning Locker takes full advantage of the power of xAPI, using the stored learning records to provide insights about learner performance and behavior. Its analytics dashboard offers a range of visualizations and reporting tools that can aid in understanding and improving learner engagement and outcomes.

One of the main benefits of Learning Locker's xAPI compatibility is its interoperability. xAPI statements are standardized, meaning they can be understood and used by any system that also follows the xAPI specification. This means records can be shared easily between different systems, allowing data from a diverse range of sources to be collated and analyzed in one place. In addition, Learning Locker's data extraction tools make it straightforward to export data from the system in a variety of formats to suit different needs.

Learning Locker doesn't natively support SCORM or IMS Caliper.

### 5\.2 Trax LRS

Trax LRS is a LRS that centralizes and processes the data gathered from learners' interactions for further analysis and reporting. The software is designed according to the xAPI specifications, making it capable of storing a wide variety of learning interaction data.

Trax LRS collects learning records by interacting with xAPI-compliant Activity Providers like LMS, mobile apps, and other similar environments. These providers send structured statements about learner activity to the LRS which captures and stores the information. xAPI statements are incredibly versatile, capable of capturing simple interactions like course completions, as well as more complex data like real-time simulations or offline learning experiences.

Once collected, the data is stored in a MySQL or PostgreSQL database and can then be aggregated, filtered, and analyzed for various learning analytics purposes. Trax LRS stores data in a structured way to allow advanced querying and enables you to use this data to generate reports and drive learning analytics and insights that can inform and improve learning processes.

As for compatibility standards, Trax LRS is fully compatible with the xAPI standard, supporting both the basic and advanced xAPI features. This means that it can effectively import learning records from other xAPI-compliant Activity Providers, and export learning records to other xAPI-compliant systems.

However, Trax LRS doesn't natively support other eLearning standards like SCORM and IMS Caliper.

### 5\.3 SCORM Cloud (Rustici LRS)

The [Rustici LRS](https://rusticisoftware.com/products/rustici-lrs/) is an integratable, ADL-conformant Learning Record Store designed to receive, store and return xAPI statements.
Rustici Software provides SCORM Cloud, which is a LRS functioning as a SaaS application offering SCORM, xAPI, cmi5, and AICC support.

SCORM Cloud collects learning records from a variety of sources, which include both online and offline learning activities. All activities are tracked using xAPI statements. These data can be generated by any learning activity and sent to the LRS. These xAPI statements encapsulate a wealth of data such as who performed the activity, what the activity was, where and when it occurred, and the result.

Rustici's SCORM Cloud solution stores all of these learning records in a secure cloud database. By leveraging the power of xAPI, cmi5, SCORM and AICC, SCORM Cloud can effectively aggregate and interpret data from various sources, allowing educators and administrators to evaluate learner progress and engagement, and gain insights from the learning data.

SCORM Cloud is one of the most compatible LRS, able to adapt and work with numerous eLearning standards. It allows learning records to travel smoothly between systems compliant with these eLearning standards, providing seamless integration and interoperability.

However, SCORM Cloud doesn't natively support IMS Caliper.

### 5\.4 Apereo OpenLRW

[Apereo Open Learning Record Warehouse (OpenLRW)](https://github.com/Apereo-Learning-Analytics-Initiative/OpenLRW) is an open-source Java-based learning record warehouse which is compatible with xAPI (Experience API), IMS Caliper, and IMS OneRoster. OpenLRW is a secure, standards-based, standalone learning record warehouse that was built to fill the need for a storage mechanism for an open learning analytics environment. Built on a scalable architecture, using modern web technologies, Apereo LRW provides the fast reads and writes necessary for a dynamic analytics environment.

OpenLRW collects data from a variety of sources, including various learning management systems (LMSs), and other learning platforms that produce structured learning data. OpenLRW collects this data by importing it directly from the source systems via predefined connectors or through file upload. The imported data can include course information, assessments, student enrollments, and activity data, among other things.

Once collected, OpenLRW stores this data in a NoSQL database (MongoDB), where it is ready for analysis. OpenLRW uses this data to deliver analytical models and measures that can help educators and administrators make evidence-based decisions to improve learning outcomes. OpenLRW also has a built-in RESTful API that allows third-party applications to access and utilize the stored data, providing flexibility for further analysis and reporting.

OpenLRW is primarily built around the IMS Caliper standard and thus it natively supports Caliper for importing and exporting learning records.

### 5\.5 GrassBlade Cloud LRS

[GrassBlade Cloud LRS](https://www.nextsoftwaresolutions.com/grassblade-lrs-experience-api/) is a high-performance LRS that helps in collecting, storing, and using learning records. It provides robust support for the xAPI standard and cmi5, enhancing the tracking of learning activities across multiple platforms.
