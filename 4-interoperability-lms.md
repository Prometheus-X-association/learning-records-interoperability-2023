[Interoperability of Learning Records:Â State-of-the-Art in 2023](/)

## 4\. Interoperability of Learning Management System

In this part, we have analysed the various Learning Management System (LMS) available on the market. For each LMS, we have gathered as much information as possible about their compatibility with the major Learning Records standards (xAPi, SCORM, IMS Caliper, cmi5) from their website, support center (forum, knoledge base) or dvelopper documentation when available.

The compatibility of the LMS with the main learningrecords standards are compiled in the table below.

### 4\.1 Moodle LMS

Moodle, one of the most popular open-source LMS, facilitates the creation of customizable online courses. It offers an array of tools and features designed specifically to aid educators in teaching and assessing student performance effectively.

Moodle collects Learning Records through various built-in modules, such as assignments, quizzes, forums, glossaries, lessons, and workshops, to name a few. It captures and stores data related to learners' interactions, completion status, assessments, and feedback, among others. This data is then stored in a [logs database](https://docs.moodle.org/402/en/Logs) (typically MYSQL or PostgreSQL), which can be accessed and manipulated by the Moodle system to generate reports, predict user behavior, and customize learning paths.

Moodle inherently supports the SCORM standard, allowing SCORM packages to be included as a type of resource. This means that SCORM-compliant content from other sources can be uploaded into Moodle and Moodle can send SCORM data - like quiz results and course completion status - back to an external LMS.

As for the xAPI standard, while Moodle does not natively support it, support can be easily added using plugins, such as '[Logstore xAPI](https://moodle.org/plugins/logstore_xapi)' plugin or '[TRAX Logs](https://moodle.org/plugins/logstore_trax), which sends Moodle events to a Learning Record Store (LRS) as xAPI statements. Enabling the xAPI plugin would allow the import and export of learning records to other software that adheres to the xAPI standard.

Moodle support IMS Caliper though a [plugin](https://docs.moodle.org/dev/Caliper).

Moodle support cmi5 using a [plugin](https://rusticisoftware.com/resources/play-xapi-and-cmi5-in-moodle/).

By leveraging additional plugins or custom development, Moodle can transform into a very standards-compliant LMS, allowing it to effectively communicate and share data with other systems. However, it is essential to remember that using third-party plugins or custom development requires additional resources and technical competencies.

### 4\.1 Open edX LMS

Open edX is an open-source learning management system (LMS) that allows educators to create and deliver online courses. It is known for its flexibility, hosting everything from small local courses to large-scale global classes.

Open edX collects a wide range of Learning Records as learners navigate through courses. This data collection includes, but isn't limited to, learners' personal information, course enrollment details, session durations, and interactions with course content such as submissions of work, peer reviews, and quizzes, among other interactions. Open edX also collects detailed event logs that track every click made within the system, providing a granular view of learner behavior. These learning records are called "[Tracking Logs events](https://edx.readthedocs.io/projects/devdata/en/latest/internal_data_formats/tracking_logs/student_event_types.html)" in open EdX documentation.

These Tracking Logs events are stored within the Open edX data stores, which consist of several MySQL databases for storing different types of data and MongoDB for storing course content. This data is then used to provide insights into student learning, to enable the customization of course material, and to generate different reports and analytics in the instructor dashboard.

Here is a list of the Student Events stored by Open edX:

* Bookmark Events
* Certificate Events
* Cohort Events (Student)
* Course Content
* Completion Event
* Content Library Interaction Events
* Course Navigation Events
* Course Resource Events
* Discussion Forum Events
* Drag and Drop Events
* Enrollment Events
* Notes Events
* Open Response Assessment Events
* Peer Instruction Events
* Poll and Survey Events
* Pre-Roll Video Interaction Events
* Problem Interaction Events
* Teams-Related Events
* Testing Events for Content Experiments
* Textbook Interaction Events
* Third-Party Content Events
* Timed Exam and Proctored Exam Events
* Video Interaction Events
* Open Response Assessment Events (Deprecated)

The following example shows the relevant fields of the event that is emitted when a user selects any hypertext link from the course breadcrumb content.

```json
{
    "name": "edx.ui.lms.jump_nav.selected",
    "event": {
        "target_name": "Part 3: Getting Social",
        "id": "block-v1:edX+DemoX+Demo_Course+type@sequential+block@simulations/block-v1:edX+DemoX+Demo_Course+type@vertical+block@d0d804e8863c4a95a659c04d8a2b2bc0",
        "current_id": "block-v1:edX+DemoX+Demo_Course+type@sequential+block@basic_questions/block-v1:edX+DemoX+Demo_Course+type@vertical+block@2152d4a4aadc4cb0af5256394a3d1fc7",
        "widget_placement": "breadcrumb"
    }
}
```

When it comes to compatibility with e-learning standards, Open edX supports Learning Tools Interoperability (LTI), which allows other LTI-compliant systems to interact with the courses hosted on the Open edX platform, and vice versa.

For SCORM, Open edX does not natively support this standard. However, a third-party XBlock, named SCORM XBlock, can be installed to integrate SCORM packages into Open edX courses, thereby extending the platform's capabilities to support the ingestion and emission of SCORM-compliant data.

Due to xAPI's extensive support and use in tracking and analysing learning activities, Open Edx is working to [support xAPI](https://docs.openedx.org/projects/openedx-proposals/en/latest/architectural-decisions/oep-0026/xapi-realtime-events.html) (at least partially)  as one of the key standards for real-time events. Open edX does not plan to create its own LRS. Instead, it aims to integrate with third-party LRS services.

xAPI specifies four standard REST-ful JSON payload APIs, but OpenEdx only needs the Statement API for tracking learning activities. This includes the following components: xAPI Actor, xAPI Verb, xAPI Object, xAPI Context, and xAPI Result.

The xAPI Actor refers to the individual performing an activity. OpenEdx will primarily use the Agent type, which can be identified by different methods, including an anonymized unique identifier of the learner.

Here is an example of anÂ ActorÂ JSON value that open edX would generate:

```json
"actor": {
    "objectType": "Agent",
    "openid": "https://openedx.org/users/user-v1:<anonymized-user-id>",
    "name": "https://openedx.org/users/user-v1:<anonymized-user-id>" Â # only include this field if necessary
}
```

The xAPI Verb denotes the past-tense action performed by the learner. OpenEdx will use standard, registered verbs as much as possible, and these are documented in the OpenEdx events section.

The registry is automatically created from multiple profiles. For now, open edX will limit ourselves to only URIs prefixed by the following domains, in the following priority order (in case of conflicting names):

* http://adlnet.gov
* http://w3id.org
* http://id.tincanapi.com

If, by any chance, a verb needed by Open edX does not exist in the registry, then open edX will create a pull request to recommend adding it to theÂ central GitHub repository of xAPI Profiles.
Here is an example of aÂ VerbÂ JSON value that OpenEdx would generate:

```json
"verb": {
    "id": "http://adlnet.gov/expapi/verbs/answered"
}
```

Note, to keep the size of events as small as possible, open edX choose to avoid extraneous fields. For example, they intentionally exclude a âdisplayâ field in the example above.

The Object refers to the activity, which OpenEdx initially defines as an xAPI Activity uniquely identified by a URI. Here is an example of anÂ ObjectÂ JSON value that Open Edx would generate:

```json
"object": {
    "id": "https://courses.openedx.org/xblock/block-v1:openedx+origami-folding+1T2018+type@problem+block@abcd",
    "definition": {
        "type": "http://adlnet.gov/expapi/activities/question",
        "name": {
            "en-US": "Question on mountain fold needed to create an origami crane base",
        }
    }
}
```

The Context field allows OpenEdx to provide additional information about each statement.
Here is an example of aÂ ContextÂ JSON value that Open Edx would generate:

```json
"context": {
    "registration": "https://openedx.org/enrollments/enrollment-v1:<anonymized-enrollment-id>",
    "contextActivities": {
        "parent": [
            {
                "objectType": "Activity",
                "id": "https://openedx.org/courses/course-v1:openedx+origami-folding+1T2018"
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

The xAPI Result specifies the score that the learner earned on an activity. OpenEdx would generate a JSON value for this, including the learner's success status, completion status, and score details. Here is an example of a JSON value that Open Edx would generate for a problem type:

```json
"result": {
    "success": false,
    "completion": true,
    "score": {
        "min": 0,
        "max": 50,
        "raw": 10,
        "scaled": 0.20
    },
    "response": "foo"
}
```

Open edX intends to support interoperability with the [IMS Caliper](https://docs.openedx.org/projects/openedx-proposals/en/latest/architectural-decisions/oep-0026/caliper-realtime-events.html) standard by using Caliper's structured approach for describing, collecting and exchanging learning activity data. Given the broad acceptance of the Caliper standard across educational institutions, Open edX sees this as an opportunity to generate events for adaptive learning engines, leading to a richer user experience.

The Caliper Sensor API helps in gathering learning metrics across systems, making it easier to marshal and transmit event data from Open edX's application to target endpoints. The set of useful profiles from Caliper for Open edX includes Assessment, Assignable, Grading, Reading, and Media.

A Caliper event describes the relationship between an actor (the learner) who performs an action on an object due to the actor's activity. Actors are typically identified by a unique identifier while keeping information to a minimum to protect the learner's privacy.

Example:

```json
{
    "id": "https://openedx.org/users/user-v1:<anonymized-user-id>",
    "type": "Person",
    "dateCreated": "2018-08-01T06:00:00.000Z",
    "dateModified": "2018-09-02T11:30:00.000Z"
}
```

Caliper actions are essentially verbs in past tense such as "Graded", "Viewed", "NavigatedTo" which bind the agent to the object.

Examples:
âNavigationEventâ supports âNavigatedToâ only.
âMediaEventâ supports a number of actions including âStartedâ, âEndedâ, âPausedâ, âResumedâ, âRestartedâ, and âForwardedToâ.

Objects are entities that an agent interacts with, and they are mostly identified by an IRI string and their type. AnÂ extensionsÂ property is also defined so that implementers can add custom attributes not described by the model. Open edX use this to pass some extra information from edX events that are not required by the Caliper specified event field. Optional properties can be ignored when describing an entity.
Example:

```json
"object": {
    "id": "block-v1:org+course+run+type@video+block@<video_id>",
    "type": "VideoObject",
    "dateCreated": "2018-11-15T10:15:00.000Z",
    "startedAtTime": "2018-11-15T10:15:00.000Z",
    "endedAtTime": "2018-11-15T10:55:12.000Z",
    "duration": "PT40M12S"
}
```

JSON-LDÂ documents require inclusion of aÂ context, denoted by the @context keyword, a property employed to map document terms to IRIs. Inclusion of a JSON-LD context provides an economical way for Caliper to communicate document semantics to services interested in consuming Caliper event data.
We can provide context in events in the following way:

```json
{
    "@context": "http://purl.imsglobal.org/ctx/caliper/v1p1",
    "id": "urn:uuid:3a648e68-f00d-4c08-aa59-8738e1884f2c",
    "type": "Event",......
}
https: //www.imsglobal.org/sites/default/files/caliper/v1p1/caliper-spec-v1p1/caliper-spec-v1p1.html#jsonldDef
```

### 4\.3 Canvas LMS

360Learning does not natively support the xAPI standard, which could restrict the import/export of learning records from other software.

360Learning does not natively support cmi5 for import/export of learning records, nor IMS Caliper.

Regarding the import and export of learning records, while SCORM-compliant content can be easily managed, full learning record portability (as enabled by standards like xAPI or cmi5) may not be available within 360Learning.

### 4\.12 Google Classroom

Google Classroom is a free LMS product developed by Google as part of its Google Workspace for Education suite. It offers features that allow educators to create, distribute, and grade assignments, as well as communicate with students.

When a user logs into Google Classroom, their activities are collected, stored, and used by Google to improve service, provide custom experiences, and make recommendations. These activities might include specific assignments completed, grades obtained, assessments given, and feedback provided. This data would generally be stored in Google's secure servers, with privacy policies and regulations ensuring the protection of user data.

Google Classroom does not natively support any of the traditional e-learning standards such as xAPI, SCORM, cMi5 or IMS Caliper for collecting, storing, and utilizing learning records. Google Classroom has its unique ways of storing and structuring data according to their internal rules and mechanisms. Therefore, implementing any of the traditional e-learning standards directly into Google Classroom is not feasible.

For the import and export of data, Google Classroom uses the [Classroom API](https://support.google.com/edu/classroom/answer/6253304?hl=en&sjid=533248504110682389-EU). Through Classroom API, developers can integrate their applications with Classroom, which allows developers to access and update Classroom data. However, Classroom API is different from the traditional e-learning standards and might require additional programming effort to convert and interpret the data in these standards.

Considering the contribution of standards like xAPI, SCORM, cMi5, and IMS Caliper to achieving interoperability, their absence in platforms like Google Classroom indeed indicates an area that would benefit from further development and integration.

### 4\.13 Microsoft Teams for education

Microsoft Teams for Education is a digital hub that incorporates Microsoft tools in a single environment. It is designed to facilitate secure collaboration and communication for classrooms, enabling teachers to distribute assignments, provide feedback, and interact with students.

Boasting an array of features, including channels, chat, video conferencing, file sharing, and more, Microsoft Teams exhibits versatility in collecting Learning Records. These records consist of assignment data, communication histories, attendance records, and, when integrated with other Microsoft Education tools, student progress information, and grades.

The information Teams collects is stored within the Microsoft Cloud, a platform designed to offer high-standard security, privacy, and compliance. The Teams compliance posture includes a comprehensive set of certifications and attestations, commitment to strong data security and privacy rights that safeguard individual privacy.

Microsoft Teams does not inherently support the import or export of data with xAPI, SCORM, cMi5, or IMS Caliper standard. However, itâs important to note that Teams, as part of the larger Microsoft 365 platform, can integrate with several LMS and third-party apps that do support these standards.

Alternatively, Microsoft offers [APIs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/education-concept-overview) and the Microsoft Graph â a unified programmability model â that allows developers to access and integrate with data in Microsoft 365, including Teams. Although customization at this level might require significant effort, it could theoretically support the extraction and interpretation of learning data in alignment with specific e-learning standards.

That said, adoption of a comprehensive standard like xAPI or IMS Caliper by significant players such as Microsoft Teams for education would serve to further harmonize the interoperability efforts within the field, making information sharing between platforms more reliable and straightforward. Similarly, offering native support for international e-learning standards presents an area of advancement that would propel the capacity for Learning Records interoperability.
