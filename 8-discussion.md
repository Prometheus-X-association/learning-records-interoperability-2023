[Interoperability of Learning Records: State-of-the-Art in 2023](/)

## 8\. Discussion

In this part, we discuss about the main findings from the previous parts.

### 8\.1 Benefits of Learning Records

Learning records provide several benefits for learners, instructors, and organizations, including:

* Personalization: Learning records enable personalized learning experiences by providing a detailed view of a learner's strengths, weaknesses, and interests.
* Assessment: Learning records allow for more accurate and comprehensive assessment of learning outcomes.
* Professional development: Learning records can be used to identify areas for improvement and development for individual learners and instructors.
* Analytics: Learning records provide data that can be analyzed to gain insights into learning patterns and trends.
* Compliance: Learning records can be used to demonstrate compliance with regulatory and accreditation requirements.

### 8\.2 Challenges of Learning Records

While learning records offer many benefits, there are also some challenges that need to be addressed, including:

* Privacy: Learning records contain sensitive information, and it is important to ensure that privacy and security are maintained.
* Interoperability: Different systems and platforms may use different formats and standards, making it challenging to share and integrate learning records.
* Usability: Learning records need to be user-friendly and accessible to all learners, regardless of their technical expertise.
* Integration: Integrating learning records with existing systems and processes may require significant effort and resources.
* Scalability: Improving the collection and aggregation of Leanring records form muiltiple source implies higher needs of computing and data storing resources.

### 8\.3 xAPI: the ideal pivot format for Learning Record interoperability

xAPI offers a significant advantage as a pivot format for the interoperability of Learning Records due to its inherent flexibility and adaptability.

For starters, the main strength of xAPI lies in its capacity to track a wide array of learning experiences from diverse contexts. Unlike traditional Learning Management Systems, which predominantly track formal learning in a structured environment, xAPI can capture, record, and analyze data that spans across multiple platforms and devices, extending to informal learning contexts such as mobile learning, games, simulations, and much more.

This inclusive tracking of learning experiences vastly enriches the learning records, providing a much more comprehensive overview of a learner's journey. It, therefore, offers tremendous potential for data-driven decision-making, personalized learning paths, and predictive analytics.

Expanding on the premise of the initial text, a clear advantage of xAPI lies in its ability to assimilate data from various sources through different authoring tools. The xAPI protocol defines a standard method to record and store these diverse experiences in a Learning Record Store (LRS), making interoperability across different systems possible. The data, organized in 'actor-verb-object' statements, offer valuable insights into student interactions with the learning resources.

Moreover, with the LRS at the heart of the xAPI, learning data can be easily shared, consolidated, and reused across different platforms and systems. This interoperability is crucial in the evolving educational landscape, marked by the use of multiple e-learning platforms and digital tools. Instructors and system administrators can pull data from different platforms into a single LRS and analyze the cumulative data, opening up a more holistic perspective of learner engagement and achievement.

The integration of xAPI in the development of adaptive learning systems exemplifies how real-time tracking of interactions can be utilized to lead personalized and self-regulated learning. The collected data offer educators an opportunity to tailor content delivery, adapting to individual learner needs and styles.

Beyond educators, this data is also conducive to learners through immediate, tangible feedback. Interactive dashboards present data in an appealing, easy-to-understand format - aiding comprehension of progress, strengths, and areas needing improvement, fostering an environment for effective self-regulated learning.

xAPI's potential as a pivot format for interoperability in Learning Records lies in its ability to structure and standardize the vast and varied data produced across digital learning platforms - enabling insightful analytics, personalized interventions, and a more integrative, enriching learning experience.

### 8\.4 Trends and implications in term of Privacy and Ethics

The advent of personnalize recommendation require collecting Learning records from multiple source (software or organisation) in order to get a full 360° view of the learner. This means sharing personal data at large scale. As the recent scandals with privacy leak of major social networks have shown, the collection and processing of large amount of personal data should be done in respect of the privacy of each individuals.

For Learning records, this means being able to share data in a safe and trusted way among multiple organisation, being able to process these data to remove sensitive information (anonymization, pseudonymization), being able to collect the consent of each learner. All of these requirements related to privacy and ethics are not the only one. To have a successful exchange of learning records among organisation, the system must also be able to aggregate these data in a similar format, be able to process these data at large scale, with low latency and low cost.

A large amount of digital traces and metadata are produced and gathered during the everyday usage of the devices connected on the internet. In education, the collection and use of digital traces and metadata produced by learners’ interaction with educational environments has allowed educational institutions to understand their learning needs in order to make the appropriate interventions. However, this entails many ethical issues and challenges.
Ethical issues have been attracting the attention of researchers for many years, beginning with the 2nd International Conference on Learning Analytics and Knowledge (LAK ’12) where articles containing references to ethical issues were presented (Drachsler & Greller, 2012;Prinsloo et al., 2012).

Slade and Prinsloo (2013) acknowledged three wide subject areas of ethical issues that often overlap each other: “the location and interpretation of data; informed consent, privacy, and the deidentification of data; the management, classification, and storage of data.”. They suggested several principles that can be used as a guide to ethical practice in Learning Analytics: The first one considers Learning Analytics as a moral practice that focuses on what is proper and ethical essential. The second one focuses on the fact that students should participate as partners and not as passive recipients of interventions and services. The third one treats the identity and the performance of students, as dynamic constructions, which change over time and in different contexts. The fourth one presents student success as a multidimensional phenomenon. The fifth one emphasizes that transparency is important in terms of the purposes and conditions under which the data will be used, who will have access to data and how the protection of individual's identity is achieved. Finally, the sixth one stresses the need of using learning analytics in higher education institutions.
When learners interact with an educational environment, they should feel safe during this interaction. This means that this environment should respect their mistakes and no discrimination of any kind will take place within it. There should be respect for the privacy of their data as well as the way it is managed. Αt this point a distinction should be made between ethics and privacy. Drachsler & Greller (2016) point out that “ethics is the philosophy of moral that involves systematizing, defending, and recommending concepts of right and wrong conduct. In that sense, ethics is rather different to privacy”. On the other hand they stress that “privacy is a living concept made out of continuous personal boundary negotiations with the surrounding ethical environment”.
Ethics and personal data protection issues should be taken into account in all educational environments related to Learning Analytics at all levels of education; in primary, secondary and higher education. At the micro level of a classroom of a school or university with a small number of learners, it is possible to manage easily the systems addressed to either teachers or learners, if certain recommendations are followed.

It is worth noting that even Berners-Lee (2017) the inventor of the internet drew our attention to 3 trends that came to the foreground. One of them states that “We’ve lost control of our personal data”. Among other things, he emphasizes that our personal data is collected, with our consent, from the websites we visit in exchange for free access to their content. As a result, on the one hand we lose control of our data so that we cannot choose with whom to share it and on the other hand, companies and governments monitor our movements on the Internet.

Ethics questions the meaning of using Learning Analytics from the perspective of a moral reflection based on self-respect, respect for others, and respect for our surroundings. Ethics also involves the pursuit of a set of principles and values that form the basis of wise action in the practice of Learning Analytics. Therefore, ethical reflection must mobilize both an ethics of conviction based on intangible principles and the assertion of values that give meaning to action, and an ethics of responsibility that questions the ends, means, and consequences of decisions and actions. These two ethics challenge each other to mutually enrich and concern both the ethical character of data production and analysis, and the ethical character of their use.

Ethical concerns must lead to examining the challenges of research in Learning Analytics in terms of public health (1), respect for privacy (2), and societal impacts (3).

#### 8\.4.1 Public Health

In terms of public health, the primary goal to ensure in the context of a Learning Analytics research is not to put participants in situations where they might be exposed to physical harm. In this regard, the risk hypotheses seem limited. One can think of the issue of exposure of sensitive individuals (particularly young children) to radio frequencies. The hypothesis appears marginal when, as is most often the case, Learning Analytics research focuses only on the traces left during interaction with an "LMS" (Learning Management System, or online learning platform, such as Moodle) or Moocs platforms, etc. But it can be considered when research uses instruments or sensors such as connected objects. The National Education system already has a set of recommendations and best practices regarding the use of Wi-Fi in establishments and schools. And, in general, the risks are no different from other uses (family, recreational, etc.) of everyday connected objects (mobile phone, tablet, computer, etc.). When, more exceptionally, research involves tools located near the head of young children (headbands to measure signs of brain activity, for example), it is perhaps advisable, as a precautionary measure, to minimize exposure time to these tools since we do not have significant clinical study on this type of experiences.

Furthermore, some equipment possibly used for eye-tracking techniques or immersive simulation experiences (augmented reality, virtual reality) could potentially cause "accommodation-vergence conflict" problems when the visual system has not finished its development. In the absence of sufficient clinical studies, it is simply appropriate again to exercise the precautionary principle in the presence of young children.

As a precautionary measure, the use of child-friendly equipment and limiting exposure time is then recommended.

#### 8\.4.2 Privacy

Learning analytics raises the question of personal data protection, which is inextricably linked to respect for privacy. Certainly, functional limits are assigned by the prescriptions of the GDPR, which require that personal data be collected for specific, explicit and legitimate purposes and that only data strictly necessary to achieve these purposes can be collected and processed. However, in the field of Learning Analytics, it is difficult to determine in advance which information about the environment and among the learning outcomes are likely to prove probative or, conversely, anecdotal. The research logic underlying learning analytics may seem difficult to reconcile with the data collection minimization logic that prevails in personal data regulation.

What data are relevant to analyze? Are they only the data recorded as part of a learning activity? Is it broader data? School data, social data (scholarship student, employee ...)? What place should be given to sensitive data such as physiological data? In this regard, beyond the requirement to comply with regulations, it is essential to establish a collective reflection on the conditions of the ethics of data collection and exploitation.

Of course, the expected benefits of Learning Analytics in terms of respecting the learner's personality are many. By associating online learning platforms with different sensors, teachers are able to analyze their students' reactions more and more finely, to assess their degree of involvement and commitment (analysis of connection frequencies, types of readings, interactions ...) and to offer support close to each learner's needs. Learning Analytics therefore lead to hope that a real "tailor-made" teaching, at the service of the learner, is not incompatible with mass teaching.

Monitoring of the learner can also be perceived as a surveillance and control device contributing to an "Orwellian" education. The "self-quantification" made possible by the development of Learning Analytics also raises the question of the anxiety-inducing nature of a performance quest that can be instrumentalized for very diverse purposes, including social control. Learning Analytics should not transform the learner into a passive data producer, nor assign them to passively comply with the recommendations or prescriptions of an algorithm.

#### 8\.4.3 Social Impact

The production, use, and reuse of Learning Analytics data raise the question of determinism, more or less intensely depending on the objectives pursued (descriptive, predictive, or prescriptive analysis), and depending on each scientific community's perception of the research product.

There seems to be an implicit hypothesis that understanding the learner and predictive modeling allow us to identify at-risk learners and personalize interventions to increase the chances of success. This is done by allowing the earlier identification of language disorders, arithmetic disorders, or motor coordination disorders and promoting rapid remediation to combat failure. However, the risk of determining a learner's future too early cannot be ignored.

The issue of a future predicted by the past is a classic ethical dilemma in reflecting on Big Data. As such, it is legitimate to question the nature of the indicators that promote the analysis of favorable predisposition situations or risk situations (predictive analytics), and the use that can be made of the profiles thus obtained.

Furthermore, by promoting adaptive learning based on personalization, Learning Analytics pave the way for differentiated pedagogy, a factor in good educational and social integration. However, Learning Analytics can also raise questions about the risk of discrimination. How can we anticipate approaches conducive to pedagogical differentiation while combating the use of indicators that can exclude? To avoid the risks associated with implicit or explicit discrimination, it is important to ensure that analyses are performed on representative data sets. Above all, it is important to allow the learner (or the person legally representing them) to prove the existence of biases and stereotypes in profiling, to demonstrate that predictive analyses are false or incomplete when a decision harms them, and to promote the exercise of the right to be forgotten.

#### 8\.4.4 Code of Practice for Learning Analytics

Jisc (2015) addressed the Code of Practice for Learning Analytics, so that educational institutions consider it when designing their educational environments. This Code consists of the following eight areas:

* Responsibility: it must be determined who will be responsible for the proper and efficient use of Learning Analytics. It must be allocated who will be in charge of components like data collection, analysis, interventions, etc. in the classroom while stakeholder representatives should be asked about Learning Analytics issues.
* Transparency and consest: involved stakeholders must be informed about what data will be collected from them and how it will be analyzed and presented. In addition, learners must be asked for their consent in order to collect and use their personal data.
* Privacy: there should be a restriction on access to learners’ data only to those who will legally need to do so. Also, special emphasis should be given to maintaining the anonymity of the users. In case of disclosure of the data to third parties, additional consent must be requested.
* Validity: the data collected by the institutions must be of high quality, broad and valid. The analysis will be done in such a way as to ensure the correct use of Learning Analytics and to understand that the existence of inconsistencies, inaccuracies and false correlations will act to the detriment of the quality of the collected data.
* Access: all learning analytics done on learners' data should be available in comprehensible and accessible form, and learners should be able to correct data that are not accurate and receive copies of this data in a portable digital format.
* Enabling positive interventions: it must be specified who and how will make the interventions when Learning Analytics reveal that a learner maybe needs more help. Resources should be allocated in such a way that learners can be treated differently depending on their needs.
* Minimising adverse impacts: it should be understood that Learning Analytics cannot fully depict the learning of each student and it should be ensured that there will be no bias of any of the stakeholders towards the learners.
* Stewardship of data: there must be compliance of the data for Learning Analytics with the data policies implemented by the institutions and the DPA. At the macro level of education, such limitations and issues should be taken into account when Learning Analytics are utilized by the institutions of a country that formulates educational policies using the demographic data of the people that make up the educational community. As one can conclude from the above, the need to develop valid and reliable Learning Analytics is of utmost importance. This has led to the production of ethics frameworks in order to identify any weaknesses in the process and correct them, developing a collection of rules and instructions in practical matters of ethics. One of the first frameworks in Learning Analytics with an emphasis on ethics developed by Slade and Prinsloo (2013) followed by JISC in 2015, which developed the Code of Practice, as both stated above. Subsequently took place the development of the DELICATE checklist (Drachsler & Greller, 2016), the SHEILA Framework (Tsai et al., 2018) and “a set of guidelines for ethically-informed practice that would be valuable to all regions of the world” by International Council for Open and Distant Education (ICDE) (Slade & Tait, 2019). On May 24 2016 entered into force a regulation and applies since 25 May 2018, for the “protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data” called GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) (“Data protection in the EU,” n.d.). Τhe processing of personal data should be supervised by the following principles (Regulation, 2018):
* the people for whom the data is collected should know what data is collected and why,
* the collection of data should be carried out only for specific purposes,
* the data being processed should be the least possible,
* the data being processed should be complete and accurate,
* the collected data should be kept for the shortest possible period of time,
* all necessary measures should be taken so that during the processing of the data
* there will be no access to persons who do not have an official permission and who intend to destroy and cause damage to them.
