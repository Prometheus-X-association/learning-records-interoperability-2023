[Interoperability of Learning Records: State-of-the-Art in 2023](README.md?fileId=116427)

## 1\. Introduction

### 1\.1 What is a Learning Record?

A learning record is a digital record of an individual's learning activities, achievements, and progress over time. It provides a comprehensive view of a learner's development, including their skills, knowledge, and competencies. Learning records can be used by learners, instructors, and organizations to track progress, identify areas for improvement, and make data-driven decisions.

### 1\.2 Interoperability of Learning Records is key for better and wider use

Interoperability refers to the ability of various information technology systems and software to promptly communicate, exchange data, and utilize the data that has been exchanged. When applied to Learning Records, interoperability creates an environment where systems involved in the learning process can exchange data and interpret shared data seamlessly. In simple terms, interoperability allows Learning Management Systems (LMS), student information systems, e-textbooks, digital learning resources, and other educational technologies to “speak the same language" about a learner history and context.

Learning Records are usually collected either in an internal database of the learning platform which generates them or in an external (standardised) Learning Record Stores (LRS). LRS are vital repositories for capturing, storing, and recalling learning activities, experiences, and achievements. Standardized LRS are a key part for the successful interoperability of Learning Records. They form an integral part of Learning Analytics, where data collected and stored facilitate the creation of personalized learning paths, early intervention strategies, and curriculum design, among other things.

The essence of such interoperability becomes more pronounced in today's learning ecosystem, which is becoming increasingly complex and diversified with numerous types of learning platforms and technologies. This complexity has given rise to information silos, where useful data as Learning Records remain confined within the boundaries of the system or organisation in which they were generated, thereby reducing their efficacy. Interoperability addresses this issue by ensuring that data isn't just shared but understood across multiple platforms and systems.

### 1\.3 Standardizing Learning Records

Over the last twenty years, several key standards have emerged to facilitate the interoperability of Learning Records.
The Shareable Content Object Reference Model (SCORM) is among the most widely used, which defines specific communications between client-side content and a host system (or LMS). Though it’s somewhat outdated, SCORM's main advantage is its broad level of adoption.
Experience API (xAPI), also known as Tin Can API, is more recent and more flexible than SCORM, capable of capturing a broader variety of learning experiences across various platforms, including mobile learning, simulations, and games.
cMi5 is another specification regarding the interoperability of Learning Records developed by the Advanced Distributed Learning (ADL). It is designed to provide a bridge between the capabilities of SCORM and xAPI. cMi5 specification allows content and e-learning systems to utilize the capabilities of xAPI while maintaining interoperability, likely similar to SCORM. It provides a set of rules for using the xAPI in the context of LMSs, allowing the LMSs to control the learner's experience, like SCORM, while opening up the possibility of tracking learning experiences in multiple environments, like xAPI.
IMS Caliper Analytics®, as defined by IMS Global Learning Consortium, is a specification developed to improve the interoperability of collected learning data and the ability to provide learning analytics, which can, in turn, enhance teaching and learning. Caliper provides a flexible framework wherein institutions can collect and use learning data from diverse digital resources to better understand and visualize learning processes, and subsequently, improve learning outcomes. By defining a metric profile, specific data points for individual learning activities can be standardized, facilitating interoperability and the transition to a complete learning analytics solution.
Learning Tools Interoperability (LTI) is a standard developed by the IMS Global Learning Consortium that enables integration of rich learning applications into the user’s learning environment, regardless of learning management system (LMS).

As we proceed in this review, these standards are vital in comprehending the current state and future trends regarding the interoperability of Learning Records.

### 1\.4 Objectives of this study

The primary objective of this bibliographical study is to review the state-of-the-art regarding the interoperability of Learning Records. It aims to collate and critically analyze the current academic and industrial literature, data models, and case studies to understand how interoperability is being implemented and the associated challenges and opportunities. Simultaneously, this study will seek to identify gaps and areas of improvement, contributing to directing future research and encouraging continual innovation in this domain.

The relevance of this research is rooted in the development of the european Dataspace for Education & Skills which promotes the growing recognition of digital learning and e-learning, magnified by the recent necessity of remote learning due to the global pandemic. As more institutions incorporate digital technologies into their pedagogical arsenal, the need for successful and safe exchange of data and interoperability grows exponentially. It's crucial not just for enhancing learning experiences and outcomes but also for administrative efficiency, improved data-driven decision-making, and policy development.
